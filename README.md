# TV-show-extension
It is a Chrome extension that searches highlighted text in a TV show database and displays the results in the extension's popup. Additionally, it will read the highlighted text using Chrome's text to speech API. *NOTE* This is my code after following "React &amp; TypeScript Chrome Extension Development [2023]" by Jason Xian from Udemy.
